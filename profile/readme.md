## Welcome

This organization contains the source code and documentation for the Arculus Zero Trust (ZT) project, showcasing a multi-faceted system that combines a core software platform with specialized machine learning modules for security and autonomous control.

## Project Repositories

Here is a breakdown of the project components:

### 1. `arculus-sw` - Arculus Software Stack
This repository contains the core Arculus software stack, including the UI, Node.js services, and database schemas. It is the central hub of the application.
* **Tech Stack:** `JavaScript (73.7%)`, `Python (15.6%)`, `Jupyter Notebook (6.4%)`, `CSS (2.3%)`, `Shell (1.1%)`, `Dockerfile (0.4%)`
* **[Go to Repository &rarr;](https://github.com/arculus-zt/arculus-sw)**

### 2. `arculus-rl` - Multi-Agent Drone Pathfinding with DQN
This repository hosts the Reinforcement Learning (RL) module for the Arculus Project. It uses a multi-agent Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach to train two drones for tactical navigation, avoiding obstacles and congestion.
* **Tech Stack:** `Jupyter Notebook (64.1%)`, `Python (35.9%)`
* **[Go to Repository &rarr;](https://github.com/arculus-zt/arculus-rl)**

### 3. `arculus-fl` - Federated Learning Intrusion Detection System
This repository contains the codebase for FL-IDS, a system designed to detect and mitigate network-level attacks (like DDoS) in drone swarms using a hybrid deep learning and Federated Learning (FL) framework.
* **Tech Stack:** `Jupyter Notebook (85.9%)`, `Python (13.8%)`, `Shell (0.3%)`
* **[Go to Repository &rarr;](https://github.com/arculus-zt/arculus-fl)**
